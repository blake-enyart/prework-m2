# Static Comp Challenges

This repository includes an `index.html` file that links to two CSS files:

* `reset.css`: includes styles that will override most default styles provided by your browser.
* `main.css`: empty file provided as a place to store styles that you define.

Beyond high level structure for an HTML page and the links to these two stylesheets, the `index.html` file is empty.

The expectation is for you to choose **one** of the images included in the `completed` directory ([1](completed/challenge1.png), [2](completed/challenge2.png), and [3](completed/challenge3.png)), and do your best to create a file that mimics the styled pages that they show.

The [site_copy.md](site_copy.md) file provides the language that you need, and the `images` directory provides images used in each of the comps.

In order to complete these challenges, fork and clone this repository, then add HTML to the `index.html` file, and CSS to the `stylesheets/main.css` file.

Feel free to organize the HTML however you would like, and create whatever styles you would like. The main goal is for you to get some practice styling a site using HTML and CSS.

If you would like additional practice, feel free to attempt either or both of the remaining challenges.
